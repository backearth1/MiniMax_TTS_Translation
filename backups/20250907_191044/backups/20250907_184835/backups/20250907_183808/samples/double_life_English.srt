[00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.039] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
Hey, Dad, can I borrow 50000 dollors?

2
[00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.199] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
Mom needs kidney dialysis and we really don't have any money.

3
[00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.759] SPEAKER_04 [emotion: neutral]
Natalie, the thing is...

4
[00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.480] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: disgusted]
How shameless have you to come here and beg us for money?

5
[00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.300] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
I'll pay you guys back, I promise.

6
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.859] SPEAKER_04 [emotion: sad]
Or maybe we can let her borrow the money.

7
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.500] SPEAKER_04 [emotion: sad]
I mean, it's her mother that's sick.

8
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.719] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: angry]
You're so thinking about your ex-wife?

9
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.699] SPEAKER_04 [emotion: sad]
No, no.

10
[00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:36.520] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: angry]
Do I need to remind you this is your family now? George,whitout me ,you have nothing

11
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.179] SPEAKER_01 [emotion: disgusted]
oh,ha, It isn't my loser sister?

12
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.320] SPEAKER_01 [emotion: disgusted]
Asking for money like a beggar, how pathetic.

13
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.859] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
This is a mistake.

14
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.799] SPEAKER_01 [emotion: neutral]

15
[00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.700] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: surprised]

16
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.060] SPEAKER_01 [emotion: neutral]

17
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.500] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: happy]
oh，ho,ho, My daughter is so smart.

18
[00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.820] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: happy]
That's a good idea.

19
[00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.140] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
Sebastian Klein.

20
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.159] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
The legitimate son of the Klein family.

21
[00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.200] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
Isn't he in jail right now?

22
[00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:08.280] SPEAKER_01 [emotion: happy]
Yup.

23
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.879] SPEAKER_01 [emotion: angry]
He's a dirt bag and a good for nothing loser.

24
[00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.439] SPEAKER_01 [emotion: angry]
That's why I can't marry him.

25
[00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:16.599] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: neutral]
That's right.

26
[00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.659] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: neutral]
Natalie is also your daughter.

27
[00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.420] SPEAKER_02 [emotion: neutral]
She can be the one who marries Sebastian Klein.

28
[00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:22.959] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
No, I'm not going to.

29
[00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.840] SPEAKER_01 [emotion: angry]
Do you want us to pay for your mother's medical bills or not?

30
[00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.359] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
Fine.

31
[00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.900] SPEAKER_00 [emotion: sad]
I'll marry Sebastian Klein.
